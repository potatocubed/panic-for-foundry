So what am I implementing, exactly?
IN ORDER:

a hex grid

Health bars, and current health
so essentially we're looking at assigning values to actors: 
  health bars, current health and current max, tokens! token counts need to be visual on the icon
  basic tokens, common tokens (inc challenge), rare tokens (inc custom tokens)
this requires Actors, and values assigned to them, and displaying those values
works for PCs and warriors
bosses probably easy this way
stooges! and the Twins custom boss

Character sheets: stances, builds, archetype data, skills
  focused/fused characters can create stances by selecting from dropdowns?
  option to rename stances, obvs
  skills are auto-picked from forms, but can be edited
frantic characters are going to be tricky

some sort of initiative tracker?
